# hipo-application
A small (and unnecessarily complex) React Native app to apply to Hipo. 

Back-end is fully functioning.
Front-end is functioning up until the `submit all`. All that's left to do is connect them with `Apollo`.

This was a good practice to learn `GraphQL, Apollo` and `Redux`. Redux part in the front end was completely just for practice, same thing could be achieved easily with the backend I wrote and `Apollo` (and it would be better).


Due to lack of time, I have to admit I am cringing at some stuff I wrote. And at the top of my head, I can point out and fix obvious errors.
It's clear that this needs improvement, but I still believe I made a solid effort.
